## ABSTRACT 
Watershed development and management plans are very important for harnessing surface water 
and groundwater resources. For these consequences, basin morphometry is a means of numerically 
analyzing or mathematically quantifying different aspects of a drainage basin. To prepare a 
comprehensive watershed development plan, it becomes necessary to understand the topography, 
erosional status and drainage pattern of the area. In the present study, GIS techniques have been 
used for the identification of geomorphological features and analyzing the properties of the 
Somehwari River basin area in Meghalaya state, India and Netrokona District, Bangladesh. The 
morphometric analysis (Topography 1955 to 2017 with variation) of the Someshwari drainage 
basin has been carried out, considering 5th aspects (Linear aspects, Areal aspects, Relief aspects, 
Drainage pattern and Cross-section morphology). Linear aspects of analysis of the Someshwari 
basin consist of several parameters such as stream order (u), stream number (Nu), stream length 
(Lu), bifurcation ratio (Rb), stream length ratio (RL), perimeter of the basin(P), length of the 
basin(Lb), fitness ratio (Rf), wandering ratio (Rw), rho coefficient (œÅ) and sinuosity index (SI) etc. 
The variation ranges of bifurcation ratio between -20.442% to 200% for the basins where the 
geologic structure does not exercise a dominant influence on the drainage pattern and indicates 
that the basin is falling under a comparatively abnormal basin category. The channel sinuosity 
values of the topography of 1955, were 1.5, which indicates the Someshwari river was a sinuous 
course, and the value changed by 2.141 in 2017, which indicates the river turned into a meandering 
course. Areal aspects of the analysis of the Someshwari basin consider several parameters as 
drainage density (Dd), stream frequency(Fs), length of overland flow (Lg), form factor (Rf), 
circularity ratio(Rc), elongation ratio (Re), drainage texture (Dt), infiltration number (If ), channel 
maintenance (C), time of concentration (Tc) and time of lag (Tl ) etc. The variation of drainage 
density increased by 22.839% in 62 years, which indicates the rate of basin surface permeability 
increased day by day. The variation of length of 18.619% indicates the basin consists of high relief 
and slope, and thus rainwater enters the stream very quickly. The value of the form factor, which 
was 0.201(1955) and 0.208(2017), further indicated the elongated nature of the basin. The relief 
aspects analysis of the Someshwari basin considers several parameters such as basin relief(H), 
relief ratio (Rh), relative relief (Rp), ruggedness number (Rn), Melton ruggedness number (MRn), 
basin slope(Sb) and ground slope(S_) etc. The variation decreased by 2.532%, which indicates the 
basin slowly turned into a high gravity of water flow as well as a high infiltration rate and low 
runoff conditions. Ruggedness number variation of 19.75% indicates the number increasing day 
by day with erosion intensity. In the drainage pattern analysis of the Someshwari basin we find 
mainly eight types of drainage pattern, such as dendritic, sub-dendritic, trellis, redial, annular, sub
parallel, rectangular and pinnate. Cross section analysis, several parameters such as Average 
Depth(D), Width of Cross-section (W), Cross sectional area(Ac), Perimeter of Cross-section (Pc), 
Wetted Width (Ww), Hydraulic Perimeter(Pw), Hydraulic Radius(R), Form Ratio of Cross-section 
(Rfc), Slope of Cross-section (Sc), Stream Velocity(V) and Discharge(Q) which variables are very 
importance for a river morphology. It is therefore recommended that human activities that could 
impact negatively on the stream network in the basin should be discouraged. This study would 
help the local people to utilize the resources for sustainability in the basin area.
